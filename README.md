FAQ
===

**How should text be formatted in these files?**

*It should follow the pattern already-present, that of 

    PHRASE_OR_WORD = "Phrase or word"
    ANOTHER_WORD   = "Another word"
  
Quotes inside the quote marks (") should be indicated using HTML entities, such as **&quote;**. See here for a list of codes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references
